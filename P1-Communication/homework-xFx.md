# Homework 1 -- xFx

## Description
We would like to extend the Fx App. The resulting App will be called xFx (short for extended Fx).
More specifically, in addition to all what Fx App offers, xFx App shall allow the client to:
1. Get the list of files that are shareable by the server
2. Resume the file download where it stopped, if there was a network connectivity issue
3. Save time and network bandwidth by not redownloading an already downloaded file, provided that its local copy has not become dirty/stale

Based on the background acquired in P1, *design* and *develop* a suitable solution for this problem.

## Deliverables
One zip file containing:
1. Design document (in plain English, does it ring a bell?): **50%**
2. Source code (in your favorite programming language): **50%**
