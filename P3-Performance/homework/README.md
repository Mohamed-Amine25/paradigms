# Homework 3
## Description
We would like to take control of a remote system, *asynchronously*. More specifically, we would like to be able to:
1. Get the name and version of the remote operating system, *asynchronously*
2. Take screenshots of the remote system, *asynchronously*
3. Reboot the remote system, *asynchronously*
Based on the background acquired in P3, and the same provider developed in Homework 2, develop a JabaScript *Promise-based* asynchronous consumer.
