## Description
As an extension of the Product Rating case study, and still *using parallelized computing*, we would like to determine:
- The weakly-rated products. A product is considered weakly rated if its average rating score is strictly less than 3
- The top-N rated products, N being a program constant
- The mean and standard deviation of product (average) ratings. [Hint](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/api/java/JavaDoubleRDD.html)
