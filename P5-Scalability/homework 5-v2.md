# Homework 5 - v2
## Description
As an extension of the Product Rating case study, and still *using parallelized computing*, we would like to determine:
- The appreciated products. A product is considered as appreciated if (and only if) its average rating score is at least 4.
- The N least rated products, N being a program constant.
- The mean and standard deviation of product (average) ratings. [Hint](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/api/java/JavaDoubleRDD.html).
