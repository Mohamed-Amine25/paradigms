# Integration: Service Oriented Model / RPC Paradigm
## Problem
The client/server model allows different processes to communicate remotely. However, designing and developing a client/server application is tedious. Indeed, it requires:
- Designing a specific protocol or, in the best case, adopting and adapting an existing (maybe standard) protocol
- Managing connections, as well as corresponding streams, on both sides
- Implementing the protocol, including (application) error management, on both sides

Also, the more services/functionality the protocol supports, the more tedious the whole process becomes!

## Objective
Can we imagine a programming paradigm, which provides us software developers, with: *the luxury to invoke remote services/functionality, as if they were local*!?

Such a paradigm would:
- increase devloper productivity by hiding all the programming hassle and details mentioned above, hence
- promote software integration

## Examples

## Brainstorming
If you were to design and develop a traditional client/server application that allows the client to perform
