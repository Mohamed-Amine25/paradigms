# Steps
## Create a Spring Boot Project
Here, we will create a Gradle project, customized with the necessary Spring Boot dependencies. Spring Boot Initializr provides a user-friendly UI to do so.
- Go to Spring Boot Initializr: https://start.spring.io/
- Choose Gradle Project + Java Language + the latest stable version of Spring Boot
- Set project metadata
- Add Spring Web dependency (Just search for *rest*)
- Hit *GENERATE*
You will get your initialized Gradle project as a zip file. Unzip it in your work/project directory.
